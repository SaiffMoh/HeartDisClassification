# Heart Disease Classification & Outlier Detection

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify heart disease presence and detect outliers in medical data. By leveraging data mining methodologies, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy and data integrity in heart disease diagnosis.

## Features
- **Heart Disease Classification**: Implements machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies anomalies in the dataset to improve data quality.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms raw medical data for better model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compares different classification models based on accuracy and other metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data preprocessing and analysis)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models and evaluation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Code development and experimentation)

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes related to heart disease diagnosis. It includes features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other key indicators. 

## Results
The project evaluates various classification models and visualizes their performance. The outlier detection module highlights potential anomalies in the dataset to improve model reliability.
